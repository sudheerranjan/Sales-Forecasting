# Sales-Forecasting
1. *Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term and long-term performance. It also helps in overall business planning, budgeting, inventory management and risk management. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons, and economic trends.*

2. *Here we are tasked with forecasting the daily sales of Rossmann   stores for upto 6 weeks in advance. Rossmann is one of the largest drugstore chains in Europe operating in 3000+ locations with a turnover of â‚¬10 billion in 2019. They offer goods related to skin, hair, body, baby, health, promotional items and many others with its product range including upto 21,700 items. In this dataset provided by [Rossmann](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data), sales of 1115 Rossmann stores are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.*
3. *We will try to use Machine Learning to forecast the sales of the retail stores step by step.*
4. *The first step in this approach is Exploratory Data Analysis which is performed in the ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb notebook.*
